# luna
Minimalistic, simple and easy module to extend and load util functions for Lua.

## Introduction
Luna provides a set of functions to extend the Lua language and make it more powerful and handier
to use, it provides a set of functions that are useful in most of the cases, it replicates some
of the features of other languages like JavaScript and Python. It follows one simple rule:
"Keep it simple, stupid", by encouraging the use of functional programming, EmmyLua like
annotations, no dependencies, no globals and no monkey patching.

## Why Luna?
Lua is a great language, but it lacks some features that are present in other languages out of the
box. You may be tempted to add your own home made functions to your Lua project to try fill the
gap, but that's not optimal all the time. Luna defines a natural way to extend Lua and make it
more powerful and handier to use while providing compatibility with your IDE and the Lua API.
